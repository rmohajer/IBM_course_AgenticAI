    "# Deep Thinking Trading System\n",
    "\n",
    "The trend is shifting from monolithic, single-purpose models to sophisticated **societies of agents**, where multiple specialized AIs collaborate to solve complex problems. This is particularly true in finance, where making a single decision requires synthesizing information from dozens of sources, from market charts and news headlines to social media sentiment and dense financial reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will build a complete, **standalone** implementation of a powerful financial analysis framework. We will define every component—from live data tools to complex agent logic—directly within this notebook, creating a self-contained pipeline that functions end-to-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **LangGraph** to orchestrate this complex workflow, **LangSmith** for tracing, a suite of LLMs to power our agents, and live web search APIs to ground their analysis in real-world, up-to-the-minute information. By the end, you will have a deep, practical understanding of how to build, run, and evaluate a sophisticated agentic system for financial analysis."

      "{'messages': [AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': \"Okay, let's tackle this request. The user wants an analysis of NVDA for trading on September 8, 2025. First, I need to figure out the time frame for the data. Since the current date is 2025-09-08, I should probably get data leading up to that date. Maybe the last 60 days to have a good sample for technical indicators.\\n\\nI'll start by using the get_yfinance_data function to retrieve the historical stock prices. The parameters would be the symbol NVDA, start_date as 2025-07-09 (60 days before September 8), and end_date as 2025-09-08. That should give enough data for analysis.\\n\\nNext, I need to get the technical indicators. The get_technical_indicators function requires the same date range. Using the same start and end dates makes sense here. The technical indicators will include things like moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc., which are essential for assessing momentum and volatility.\\n\\nWait, I should check if the functions require any specific parameters. Both functions need the symbol, start_date, and end_date. The user mentioned the current date is 2025-09-08, so the end_date should be that. The start_date is a bit flexible, but 60 days is a common lookback period for technical analysis. \\n\\nI should make sure the dates are correct. July has 31 days, so July 9 plus 60 days would be September 8. That's correct. So the start_date is 2025-07-09. \\n\\nOnce I have the data from both functions, I can compile the information into a report. The report should summarize the price action, key indicators, and any notable trends or signals. The user might be looking for whether the stock is overbought, oversold, or has strong momentum. \\n\\nI need to execute both function calls first. Let me structure the tool calls properly. First, get the stock data, then the technical indicators. Each in separate tool_call blocks. Make sure the JSON is correctly formatted with the right parameters. No typos in the dates or symbol. \\n\\nAfter getting the results, I'll analyze the data. For example, if the RSI is above 70, it might indicate overbought conditions. If the MACD is positive and increasing, that's a bullish sign. The moving averages can show the trend direction. Volatility can be assessed using ATR (Average True Range). \\n\\nI should present the findings clearly, maybe in a table for the technical indicators. Also, mention any key patterns like support/resistance levels if they're part of the data. Since the user is interested in trading on the specific date, focusing on recent indicators close to September 8 would be important. \\n\\nWait, the technical indicators function might return data for the entire period. I'll need to highlight the most recent values. For example, the 50-day moving average as of September 8. Also, check if there's any divergence between price and indicators which could signal potential reversals. \\n\\nI think that's a solid plan. Now, proceed to make the tool calls.\\n\", 'tool_calls': [{'id': '0k7ck080w', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"end_date\":\"2025-09-08\",\"start_date\":\"2025-07-09\",\"symbol\":\"NVDA\"}', 'name': 'get_yfinance_data'}, 'type': 'function'}, {'id': 'mrhxgjezj', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"end_date\":\"2025-09-08\",\"start_date\":\"2025-07-09\",\"symbol\":\"NVDA\"}', 'name': 'get_technical_indicators'}, 'type': 'function'}]}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 794, 'prompt_tokens': 525, 'total_tokens': 1319, 'completion_time': 1.708113897, 'prompt_time': 0.038878684, 'queue_time': 0.617512494, 'total_time': 1.746992581}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--e8fc583e-34df-404f-95d9-c0070f03b83a-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'get_yfinance_data', 'args': {'end_date': '2025-09-08', 'start_date': '2025-07-09', 'symbol': 'NVDA'}, 'id': '0k7ck080w', 'type': 'tool_call'}, {'name': 'get_technical_indicators', 'args': {'end_date': '2025-09-08', 'start_date': '2025-07-09', 'symbol': 'NVDA'}, 'id': 'mrhxgjezj', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 525, 'output_tokens': 794, 'total_tokens': 1319})], 'market_report': ''}\n",

The user wants me to analyze NVDA for trading on 2025-09-08. First, I need to get the historical data and technical indicators for the stock. The data provided starts from 2025-07-09 up to 2025-09-05. \\n\\nI should check if the data covers the necessary period. The user's target date is September 8th, but the latest data is September 5th. Maybe the data is up to that date. Since the tools are supposed to fetch data, but in the tool response, the data ends on 2025-09-05. I need to make sure that the technical indicators are calculated correctly based on this data.\\n\\nLooking at the technical indicators response, there's a KeyError for 'date'. Hmm, that might be an issue with the data structure. The user might expect dates in the indicators. Also, the indicators like MACD, RSI, etc., are there but without dates. Maybe the function returns the latest values. \\n\\nWait, the user's current date is 2025-09-08, and they want analysis for trading on that date. The latest data point is September 5th. So the analysis is based on data up to that point. The technical indicators provided are for the latest available date. \\n\\nFor the summary, I need to present the key indicators. The MACD is 1.23, Signal is 0.45, so the MACD line is above the signal, which might indicate a bullish trend. RSI is 58.67, which is in neutral territory. Bollinger Bands show the close is near the middle band. OBV is increasing, which is positive. \\n\\nThe stock has been volatile, with a high close on August 28th at 180.17, then dropping to 174.18 on September 2nd. The latest close on September 5th is 167.02. The volume has been high, especially on September 2nd and 28th. \\n\\nThe analysis should mention the recent price action, the technical indicators, and possible trading signals. Since RSI is neutral, there's no overbought or oversold condition. The MACD suggests a potential buy if the trend continues. However, the recent price drop might indicate some weakness. \\n\\nI should also note the limitations, like the data not including the exact date of September 8th, so the analysis is based on prior data. The user might need to consider more recent data if available. \\n\\nPutting it all together, the summary table should list the indicators with their values and a brief interpretation. The conclusion would be that the stock is in a mixed trend, with some positive momentum but also signs of volatility. Traders might look for a potential rebound or continuation depending on the indicators.\\n\"}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1220, 'prompt_tokens': 5348, 'total_tokens': 6568, 'completion_time': 3.457370115, 'prompt_time': 0.850846943, 'queue_time': 0.321668066, 'total_time': 4.308217058, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'cached_tokens': 512}}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--e2d3da94-fc86-4b8f-8f1b-6e3cfede81ba-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 5348, 'output_tokens': 1220, 'total_tokens': 6568})], 'market_report': \"Here's the analysis of NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) for trading on 2025-09-08, based on historical data up to 2025-09-05:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Price Action Summary**\\n- **Recent High**: $184.47 (2025-08-28)  \\n- **Recent Low**: $164.07 (2025-07-14)  \\n- **Latest Close**: $167.02 (2025-09-05)  \\n- **Volume Trends**: Elevated volume observed on 2025-08-28 ($281.8M) and 2025-09-02 ($231.2M), indicating potential volatility.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Technical Indicators Analysis**  \\n| Indicator       | Value       | Interpretation                          |\\n|-----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|\\n| **MACD**        | 1.23        | Bullish momentum (MACD > Signal line)    |\\n| **Signal Line** | 0.45        |                                          |\\n| **RSI (14)**    | 58.67       | Neutral (not overbought/oversold)        |\\n| **Bollinger Bands** | Close near middle band | Suggests consolidation phase       |\\n| **OBV**         | ↑ 1.2B      | On-balance volume trending upward        |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Trading Signals**  \\n1. **Bullish Signs**:  \\n   - MACD crossover suggests potential upward momentum.  \\n   - Rising OBV indicates accumulation.  \\n\\n2. **Bearish Risks**:  \\n   - Price recently pulled back from 2025-08-28 highs ($180–184 range).  \\n   - RSI near midpoint implies no strong directional bias.  \\n\\n3. **Volatility**:  \\n   - 14-day historical volatility: ~12.5% (based on closing prices).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Recommendation**  \\n- **Short-Term**: Consider a **buy on dips** strategy near support levels ($165–168) if MACD remains positive.  \\n- **Risk Management**: Place stop-loss below $160 to mitigate downside.  \\n- **Caution**: Avoid overexposure due to high volatility and mixed momentum signals.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Limitations**  \\n- Analysis excludes real-time data for 2025-09-08.  \\n- Recent price action (2025-09-02 to 2025-09-05) shows mixed signals; confirm with intraday data if available.  \\n\\nLet me know if you'd like to refine this analysis further!\"}\n"

Action Summary**\\n- **Recent High**: $184.47 (2025-08-28)  \\n- **Recent Low**: $164.07 (2025-07-14)  \\n- **Latest Close**: $167.02 (2025-09-05)  \\n- **Volume Trends**: Elevated volume observed on 2025-08-28 ($281.8M) and 2025-09-02 ($231.2M), indicating potential volatility.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Technical Indicators Analysis**  \\n| Indicator       | Value       | Interpretation                          |\\n|-----------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|\\n| **MACD**        | 1.23        | Bullish momentum (MACD > Signal line)    |\\n| **Signal Line** | 0.45

suggests potential upward momentum.  \\n   - Rising OBV indicates accumulation.  \\n\\n2. **Bearish Risks**:  \\n   - Price recently pulled back from 2025-08-28 highs ($180–184 range).  \\n   - RSI near midpoint implies no strong directional bias.  \\n\\n3. **Volatility**:  \\n   - 14-day historical volatility: ~12.5% (based on closing prices).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Recommendation**  \\n- **Short-Term**: Consider a **buy on dips** strategy near support levels ($165–168) if MACD remains positive.  \\n- **Risk Management**: Place stop-loss below $160 to mitigate downside.  \\n- **Caution**: Avoid overexposure due to high volatility and mixed momentum signals.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Limitations**  \\n- Analysis excludes real-time data for 2025-09-08.  \\n- Recent price action (2025-09-02 to 2025-09-05) shows mixed signals; confirm with intraday data if available.  \\n\\nLet me know if you'd like to refine this analysis further!\"}\n",

They mentioned using the get_social_media_sentiment tool. First, I need to check if I have the right tools. Yes, the tool requires a ticker and trade date. The user provided both, so I should call the function with those parameters.\\n\\nWait, the user also included historical stock data in their previous message. But the current task is about social media sentiment. The stock data might be useful for context, but the main focus here is on sentiment analysis. I need to make sure I'm not missing any steps. The user wants a comprehensive report, including a summary table for traders. \\n\\nSo, the first step is to use the get_social_media_sentiment function with ticker NVDA and trade_date 2025-09-08. Once I get the sentiment data, I can analyze the sentiment trends, identify key themes, and correlate them with the stock's recent performance. The historical data shows some volatility, especially in August and September. Maybe the sentiment can explain some of those price movements. \\n\\nI should also consider the volume of discussions. High volume with positive sentiment could indicate a buying opportunity, while high volume with negative sentiment might signal a sell-off. The report should highlight the overall sentiment, key drivers, and implications for traders. The summary table should include metrics like sentiment score, volume, key themes, and trading implications. \\n\\nWait, the user mentioned the current date is 2025-09-08. The trade_date parameter in the tool is set to the same date. I need to confirm if the tool can fetch data for that specific date. Assuming it can, proceed with the function call. Once the data is retrieved, I can start analyzing. If there's an error, I might need to adjust, but for now, proceed as instructed.\\n\", 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'bsgw6z9gv', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"ticker\":\"NVDA\",\"trade_date\":\"2025-09-08\"}', 'name': 'get_social_media_sentiment'}, 'type': 'function'}]}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 441, 'prompt_tokens': 5166, 'total_tokens': 5607, 'completion_time': 1.226745821, 'prompt_time': 0.246415394, 'queue_time': 0.211384549, 'total_time': 1.473161215}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--eadbe137-5c4d-48c4-af10-098dd76514e0-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'get_social_media_sentiment', 'args': {'ticker': 'NVDA', 'trade_date': '2025-09-08'}, 'id': 'bsgw6z9gv', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 5166, 'output_tokens': 441, 'total_tokens': 5607})], 'sentiment_report': ''}\n",

We have a perfect alignment across all vectors: technicals show a clear and sustained uptrend, fundamentals are driven by the generational AI boom, social media sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, and the news cycle is providing nothing but tailwinds. Every piece of data points to the same conclusion. This is a market leader firing on all cylinders in a sector with secular growth. To not be long this stock is to ignore the most obvious trend in the market today.\n",

      "**Bear's Rebuttal:**\n",
      "My opponent sees a perfect picture, but I see a stock priced for a future that has no room for error. The high P/E ratio is a major vulnerability. The 'overwhelmingly bullish' sentiment is a classic sign of market euphoria, which often precedes a sharp correction. While the fundamentals are currently strong, the semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical. Any hint of a slowdown in AI spending or increased competition could cause this stock to fall dramatically. A prudent strategy would be to wait for a significant pullback to establish a position, not to chase it at all-time highs.\n",

Waiting for a 'significant pullback' in a stock with this kind of momentum has historically been a losing strategy. The valuation is high because the growth is generational. We should be buying strength, not waiting for a weakness that may never come.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Bear's Final Argument:**\n",
      "Calling the AI boom non-cyclical is pure speculation. All industries, especially in technology, experience cycles of boom and bust. Even if the long-term trend is up, the risk of a 30-40% drawdown from these levels is very real. The current price already reflects years of future growth. A simple HOLD recommendation allows us to avoid the significant downside risk while we wait for a more attractive risk/reward entry point. Buying now is a gamble, not an investment.\n"

The risk of waiting for a pullback and missing further upside appears greater than the risk of a valuation-driven correction at this time.\n",

If the stock experiences a minor pullback towards its 50-day moving average, use this as an opportunity to add to the position. A firm stop-loss should be placed below the 200-day moving average to protect against a major trend change.\n"

    "\n",
    "We have successfully built, executed, and evaluated a complex, standalone multi-agent financial analysis pipeline from scratch. By replicating the structure of a real-world trading firm, we've demonstrated how specialized agents can collaborate to transform raw, multi-source live data into a single, reasoned, and actionable trading decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- **Division of Labor is Powerful:** Assigning specific roles to different agents allows for deeper, more focused analysis at each stage.\n",
    "- **Adversarial Debates Improve Robustness:** The Bull vs. Bear and Risk Management debates are critical for stress-testing ideas and uncovering hidden risks.\n",
    "- **Orchestration is Key:** `LangGraph` provides the essential framework for managing the complex state and conditional logic required for such a system to function automatically.\n",
    "- **Evaluation is Multi-Faceted:** A robust evaluation framework combines qualitative checks (LLM-as-a-Judge), objective outcomes (Ground Truth), and process checks (Factual Consistency, Tool Usage).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Directions:**\n",
    "- **Rigorous Backtesting:** The next logical step is to run this pipeline over thousands of historical data points to statistically evaluate its long-term performance (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, etc.).\n",
    "- **Expanding the Toolkit:** More sophisticated tools could be added, such as those for analyzing options data, economic calendars, or alternative datasets.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Agent Selection:** A more advanced supervisor could dynamically choose which analysts to deploy based on the specific stock or market conditions, optimizing for cost and relevance."
