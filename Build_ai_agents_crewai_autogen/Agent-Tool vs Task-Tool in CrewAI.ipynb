    "Build a specialized agentic AI chatbot with CrewAI in only 30 minutes! This lab will teach you how to use tools with agentic workflows to solve real-world challenges. You'll create and orchestrate AI agents, define multi-step workflows, and explore the differences between assigning tools at the Agent level versus the Task level. This hands-on project is a necessity for all software and machine learning engineers looking to build more efficient and reliable multi-agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's your challenge: You've been hired by \"The Daily Dish,\" a popular restaurant with a customer service problem. Chef Maria, the owner, needs your help: \"My team spends hours answering the same questions about reservations, menu details, and our location,\" she explains. \"Build me a chatbot that can handle these inquiries intelligently, so my staff can focus on creating exceptional dining experiences.\" Chef Maria provides a PDF of frequently asked questions (FAQs) to serve as the primary knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll solve this by building a crew of AI agents that can search the FAQ document, browse the web for supplementary information, and synthesize the findings into a friendly, helpful response for the customer. Most importantly, you will learn how to make this process more robust and efficient by assigning tools directly to the tasks that need them.\n"

    "\n",
    "**1. Agent-Centric Approach (The Generalist):**\n",
    "This is the most common method. You give an agent a 'toolbox' containing all the tools it might possibly need. The agent then uses its intelligence (the LLM's reasoning ability) to decide which tool is best for the situation at hand. This is flexible but can sometimes lead to the agent making mistakes or using tools inefficiently.\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Task-Centric Approach (The Specialist):**\n",
    "In this more advanced approach, you don't give the tools to the agent directly. Instead, you attach specific tools to the specific **Tasks** that require them. When the agent starts a task, it is temporarily granted access to only the tools needed for that job. This creates a much more focused and predictable workflow.\n",
