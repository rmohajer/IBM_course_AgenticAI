    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the advanced retrieval techniques, let's understand the foundational concepts that make these retrievers powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Advanced Retrievers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced retrievers in LlamaIndex are sophisticated components that go beyond simple vector similarity search to provide more nuanced, context-aware, and intelligent information retrieval. They combine multiple techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic Understanding**: Using embeddings to understand meaning and context\n",
    "- **Keyword Matching**: Precise term-based search for exact specifications\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Context**: Maintaining relationships between different levels of information\n",
    "- **Multi-Query Processing**: Generating and combining results from multiple query variations\n",
    "- **Fusion Techniques**: Intelligently combining results from different retrieval methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are Advanced Retrievers Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Accuracy**: Advanced retrievers can find more relevant information by using multiple search strategies\n",
    "2. **Better Context Preservation**: They maintain important relationships between pieces of information\n",
    "3. **Reduced Hallucination**: More precise retrieval leads to more accurate AI responses\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: Efficient retrieval strategies work better with large document collections\n",
    "5. **Flexibility**: Different retrieval methods can be combined for optimal results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index Types Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before exploring advanced retrievers, it's helpful to first understand the three main index types supported by LlamaIndex. Each is designed to support different retrieval scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "**VectorStoreIndex:**\n",
    "- Stores vector embeddings for each document chunk\n",
    "- Best suited for semantic retrieval based on meaning\n",
    "- Commonly used in LLM pipelines and RAG applications\n",
    "\n",
    "**DocumentSummaryIndex:**\n",
    "- Generates and stores summaries of documents at indexing time\n",
    "- Uses summaries to filter documents before retrieving full content\n",
    "- Especially useful for large and diverse document sets that cannot fit in the context window of an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "**KeywordTableIndex:**\n",
    "- Extracts keywords from documents and maps them to specific content chunks\n",
    "- Enables exact keyword matching for rule-based or hybrid search scenarios\n",
    "- Ideal for applications requiring precise term matching\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Data Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a collection of AI and machine learning documents to demonstrate different retrieval strategies.\n"

    "## 2. BM25 Retriever - Advanced Keyword-Based Search\n",
    "\n",
    "BM25 is a keyword-based retrieval method that improves on TF-IDF by addressing some of its key limitations. It's widely used in production search systems including Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding TF-IDF: The Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into BM25, let's understand **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), which BM25 builds upon:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures how often a word appears in a document\n",
    "- Example: If \"neural\" appears 3 times in a 100-word document, TF = 3/100 = 0.03\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Measures how rare a word is across all documents\n",
    "- Example: If \"neural\" appears in only 2 out of 1000 documents, IDF = log(1000/2) = 6.21\n",
    "- Common words like \"the\" have low IDF; rare technical terms have high IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF Score**: TF × IDF\n",
    "- Highlights words that are frequent in one document but rare across the collection\n",
    "- Developed by Karen Spärck Jones, who pioneered the concept of term specificity\n",
    "\n",
    "### How BM25 Improves Upon TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key BM25 Improvements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency Saturation**: BM25 reduces the impact of repeated terms using term frequency saturation\n",
    "   - Problem: In TF-IDF, if a word appears 100 times vs 10 times, the score increases linearly\n",
    "   - Solution: BM25 uses a saturation function that plateaus after a certain frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document Length Normalization**: BM25 adjusts for document length, making it more effective for keyword-based search\n",
    "   - Problem: In TF-IDF, longer documents have unfair advantages\n",
    "   - Solution: BM25 normalizes scores based on document length relative to average\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tunable Parameters**: Allows fine-tuning for different types of content\n",
    "   - k1 ≈ 1.2: Controls term frequency saturation (how quickly scores plateau)\n",
    "   - b ≈ 0.75: Controls document length normalization (0=none, 1=full)\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use BM25\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Technical documentation where exact terms matter\n",
    "- Legal documents with specific terminology\n",
    "- Product catalogs with precise specifications\n",
    "- Academic papers with specialized vocabulary\n",
    "- Applications requiring keyword-based retrieval rather than semantic similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Excellent precision for exact term matches\n",
    "- Fast computational performance\n",
    "- Proven effectiveness in production systems\n",
    "- No training required (unlike neural approaches)\n",
    "- Interpretable scoring mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- No semantic understanding (doesn't handle synonyms)\n",
    "- Struggles with typos and variations\n",
    "- Limited context understanding\n",
    "- Requires careful parameter tuning for optimal performance\n"

    "## 3. Document Summary Index Retrievers\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Summary Index Retrievers use document summaries instead of the actual documents to find relevant content, making them efficient for large collections. **They return the original documents, not their summaries.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works (from authoritative source)**:\n",
    "- **Generates and stores summaries of documents** at indexing time\n",
    "- **Uses summaries to filter documents** before retrieving full content\n",
    "- **Two-stage Process**: First uses summaries to filter documents, then returns full document content\n",
    "- **Especially useful for large, diverse corpora** that cannot fit in the context window of an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two Retrieval Options**: \n",
    "1. **DocumentSummaryIndexLLMRetriever**: \n",
    "   - Uses a large language model to analyze the query against document summaries\n",
    "   - Provides intelligent document selection but can be more time-consuming and expensive\n",
    "   - Best for complex queries requiring nuanced understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DocumentSummaryIndexEmbeddingRetriever**: \n",
    "   - Uses semantic similarity between the query and summary embeddings\n",
    "   - Faster and more cost-effective than LLM-based approach\n",
    "   - Good for straightforward similarity matching\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use (based on authoritative guidance):**\n",
    "- Large document collections where documents cover different topics\n",
    "- When you need efficient document-level filtering before detailed retrieval\n",
    "- Multi-document QA where documents have distinct subject matters\n",
    "- Large and diverse document sets that cannot fit in the context window of an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration Parameters:**\n",
    "- `choice_top_k` (LLM retriever): Number of documents to select\n",
    "- `similarity_top_k` (Embedding retriever): Number of documents to select\n",
    "- Default is 1, increase for multiple document retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point**: **Returns original documents, not their summaries** - the summaries are only used for filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths**: \n",
    "- Efficient document selection and reduces search space\n",
    "- Good for heterogeneous collections with diverse topics\n",
    "- Returns original documents with full context intact\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**: \n",
    "- Requires LLM for summary generation during indexing\n",
    "- May lose some detail present in original documents during summary creation\n",
    "- LLM-based version can be slower and more expensive than other options\n"

    "Auto Merging Retriever is designed to preserve context in long documents using a hierarchical structure. **It uses hierarchical chunking to break documents into parent and child nodes, and if enough child nodes from the same parent are retrieved, the retriever returns the parent node instead.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works (from authoritative source)**:\n",
    "- **Uses hierarchical chunking** to break documents into parent and child nodes\n",
    "- **Retrieves parent if enough children match** - intelligent merging logic\n",
    "- **Preserves context in long documents** by consolidating related content\n",
    "- **Dual Storage**: Smaller child chunks are indexed in the vector store for precise matching, while larger parent chunks are stored in the docstore\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key behavior pattern**:\n",
    "- Child chunks enable precise matching for specific queries\n",
    "- When multiple child chunks from the same parent are retrieved, the system returns the parent chunk\n",
    "- This **helps consolidate related content and preserve broader context**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use (based on authoritative guidance):**\n",
    "- Long documents where small chunks lose important surrounding context\n",

    "**Configuration:**\n",
    "- `chunk_sizes`: List of chunk sizes from largest to smallest (e.g., [512, 256, 128])\n",

    "\n",
    "Reciprocal Rank Fusion is the most robust fusion method in QueryFusionRetriever, designed to combine ranked lists from multiple query variations by using the reciprocal of ranks, which reduces the impact of outliers and provides stable fusion results.\n",

    "- `rank_i(d)` is the rank of document d in query variation i's results\n",
    "- `k` is a constant (typically 60) that controls the fusion behavior\n",

    "**Why RRF works well for query fusion**:\n",
    "- **Scale-invariant**: Works regardless of individual query result score ranges\n",
    "- **Robust to outliers**: Reciprocal function reduces impact of extreme rankings\n",

    "### 6.3 Distribution-Based Score Fusion Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution-Based Score Fusion uses statistical properties of score distributions from each query variation to normalize and combine retrieval results, providing the most sophisticated handling of score variability and reliability across different query formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works within QueryFusionRetriever**:\n",
    "- Generates multiple query variations using LLM\n",
    "- Analyzes the statistical distribution of scores from each query variation\n",
    "- Normalizes scores using distribution parameters (mean, standard deviation, percentiles)\n",
    "- Applies statistical transformations like z-score normalization or percentile ranking\n",
    "- Combines normalized scores with confidence weighting based on distribution characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical approaches used**:\n",
    "1. **Z-score normalization**: Centers scores around mean with unit variance\n",
    "   - Formula: `z_score = (score - mean) / std_dev`\n",
    "   - Converts to [0,1] range using sigmoid: `1 / (1 + exp(-z_score))`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Percentile ranking**: Converts scores to percentile positions\n",
    "   - Formula: `percentile = rank(score) / total_results`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Distribution-aware normalization**: Considers score distribution shape\n",
    "   - Uses IQR (Interquartile Range) to adjust for distribution spread\n",
    "   - Handles multi-modal distributions from different query variations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Distribution-Based Fusion excels for query variations**:\n",
    "- **Statistical robustness**: Accounts for how scores are distributed within each query variation\n",
    "- **Adaptive weighting**: Can weight query variations based on their score distribution confidence\n",
    "- **Outlier handling**: Statistical methods naturally handle extreme scores\n",
    "- **Multi-modal support**: Each query variation may have different score distribution characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Distribution-Based mode**:\n",
    "- When query variations produce very different score distributions\n",
    "- For complex queries where some variations are much more reliable than others\n",
    "- When you need statistically principled score combination\n",
    "- In scenarios with noisy or unreliable retrieval scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced features in QueryFusionRetriever context**:\n",
    "- Automatic distribution analysis for each query variation\n",
    "- Confidence-based weighting of query variations\n",
    "- Robust handling of varying result set sizes\n",
    "- Statistical outlier detection within query results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "- Most statistically principled approach to query fusion\n",
    "- Handles complex score distributions effectively\n",
    "- Adapts to different query variation characteristics\n",
    "- Robust to various types of score variability and noise\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**:\n",
    "- Most computationally intensive fusion method\n",
    "- Requires sufficient results for reliable distribution estimation\n",
    "- May over-normalize in some simple scenarios\n",
    "- More complex to interpret than simpler fusion methods\n",

    "## Recommended Retrievers by Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the authoritative source and the characteristics of each retriever, here are recommended approaches for different scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Q&A Applications:**\n",
    "- **Primary**: Vector Index Retriever for semantic understanding\n",
    "- **Enhancement**: Combine with BM25 Retriever using Query Fusion for hybrid approach\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Combines semantic relevance with keyword matching\n",
    "- **From authoritative source**: \"For general Q&A, use a vector index retriever, potentially combined with a BM25 retriever. This retriever fusion combines semantic relevance with keyword matching.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Documentation:**\n",
    "- **Primary**: BM25 Retriever for exact term matching\n",
    "- **Enhancement**: Vector Index Retriever as secondary for contextual flexibility\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Prioritizes exact technical terms while maintaining semantic understanding\n",
    "- **From authoritative source**: \"For technical documents, especially those where exact terms need to be prioritized, consider making BM25 your primary retriever, with the vector index retriever adding contextual flexibility as a secondary retriever.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Documents:**\n",
    "- **Primary**: Auto Merging Retriever\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Retrieves longer parent versions only if enough shorter child versions are retrieved, preserving context\n",
    "- **From authoritative source**: \"For long documents, the auto merging retriever is a great option, because it will retrieve longer parent versions only if enough shorter child versions are retrieved.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Papers:**\n",
    "- **Primary**: Recursive Retriever\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Follows citations and references to retrieve relevant content from cited papers\n",
    "- **From authoritative source**: \"For research papers, use the recursive retriever in order to retrieve relevant content from cited papers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large Document Collections:**\n",
    "- **Primary**: Document Summary Index Retriever for initial filtering\n",
    "- **Enhancement**: Followed by Vector Index Retriever for detailed search within relevant documents\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Narrows down relevant documents first, then performs detailed retrieval\n",
    "- **From authoritative source**: \"For large document sets, consider using the document summary index retriever to narrow down the number of relevant documents, followed by a vector search within the remaining subset to retrieve the most pertinent content.\"\n"
